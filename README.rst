BlockMRS
======================================
Sports Medical Records on a Blockchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BlockMRS is a privacy concious, decentralized, blockchain-backed, medical
record system for the 21st Century.

It stores patient records in IPFS using state-of-the art asymetric encryption
giving patients control over their health data.

Privacy Concious
----------------

BlockMRS is designed with the patient's privacy in mind.  BlockMRS generates a
new public-private key for every transaction on the blockchain and each block
has a constant size. This ensures that malicious actors cannot infer anything
about a patient by inspecting the blockchain.

Distributed
-----------
BlockMRS uses a distrubuted filesystem called *InterPlanetary File System
(IPFS)* to store medical records. This creates a common way for medical service
providers to access the latest, up-to-date patient data.

Blockchain-Backed
-----------------
BlockMRS takes advantage of the latest blockchain technology to allow for
seamless transfer of medical data. Blocks on the blockchain are signed and
ecrypted to ensure authenticity and privacy.
